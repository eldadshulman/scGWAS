Genetic mapping of developmental trajectories for complex traits and
diseases
================

This repository contains explanations and example scripts for or
pipeline for genetic mapping of developmental trajectories for complex
traits and diseases. The pipeline is based on integrative analysis of
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and single-cell RNA-seq
(scRNA-seq).

The analysis performs the following three main tasks:

1.  Identification of connections between developmental trajectories and
    traits.

See the following (vignette)\[\] for example code.

2.  Elucidate molecular pathways that underlie the link between the
    trajectory and trait

See the following vignette for example code.

3.  Prioritize genes that carry the link between the pathway, trait and
    trajectory

See the following vignette for example code.
