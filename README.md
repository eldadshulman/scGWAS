Genetic mapping of developmental trajectories for complex traits and
diseases
================

This repository contains explanations and example scripts for or
pipeline for genetic mapping of developmental trajectories for complex
traits and diseases. The pipeline is based on integrative analysis of
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and single-cell RNA-seq
(scRNA-seq).

The analysis performs the following three main tasks:

#### 1\. Identification of connections between developmental trajectories and traits.

See the following
[vignette](https://github.com/eldadshulman/scGWAS/blob/master/vignettes/vignette.md)
for example code.

#### 2\. Elucidate molecular pathways that underlie the link between the trajectory and trait

#### 3\. Prioritize genes that carry the link between the pathway, trait and trajectory
